Velo code to add an out of office one-time popup notification

the code in the other file will show a popup to the user if it is the first time visiting the site in their current session. To set this up:
1) Create a lightbox named "Announcement" (note that you don't include the quotation marks when naming the box, and the A should be capitalized).
2) Set the Announcement lightbox settings (click the gear to pull these up): Automatically display lightbox on pages should be set to "no." 
  "How does the lightbox close" should be set to your preference.
3) Save the lightbox
4) Open Dev Mode by clicking "Dev Mode"
5) Copy the code from the "velo_code" file (https://github.com/HudsonLanier/wix_out_of_office/blob/main/velo_code) and paste it into the code editor that opens at the bottom of the page (it's a box with numbered lines that looks a lot like this page)
6) Save and publish
7) When you no longer want to run the popup, delete the code from the code editor in Dev Mode. Then save and publish again.
